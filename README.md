# dunjoneer
A simple game. This is just a big test, don't expect much.

The whole thing will only require Irrlicht, and shall be compatible with Linux and Mac OSX.

`./compile.sh` should be all you need, but you might want to tweak a few things (your compiler, for example).

Build status on OSX/Linux:
